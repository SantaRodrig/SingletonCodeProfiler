# SingletonCodeProfiler
In this Project, a code profiler was created using the singleton pattern in java.

The code profiler is able to measure how long a sections of code took to execute and can hold a message with it.

Another feature includes to keep track of how many times a section of code was executed. If one wanted to, they could turn off the feature to stop keeping track of data.

Lastly, the program was able to produce a report that would list the average time for each of the timers displaying their name the longest and shortes time for each timer, a detailed list of exact timer duration, and how many times a section of the code was called.
